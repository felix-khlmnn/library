A deb is a standard Unix ar archive that contains your application and other utility files. The most important one is the control file, which stores the information about the deb package and the program it installs.
Internally, a deb package contains a collection of folders that mimics a typical Linux file system, such as /usr, /usr/bin, /opt and so on. A file put in one of those directories will be copied to the same location in the actual file system during installation. So, for example a binary file put into <.deb>/usr/local/bin/binaryfile will be installed to /usr/local/bin/binaryfile.
On the outside instead, all deb package files follow a specific naming convention:

<name>_<version>-<revision>_<architecture>.deb

That is:

 - <name> – the name of your application;
 - <version> – the version number of your application;
 - <revision> – the version number of the current deb package;
 - <architecture> – the hardware architecture your program will be run on

For example, suppose you want to release your program called hello, version 1.0, built for 64-bit ARM processors. Your deb file name would look something like hello_1.0-1_arm64.deb

Making the package

Prereqisites: dpkg-deb installed

1. Make a temporary working directory following the aforementioned naming convention
2. Create the internal structure of the directory (mimicking a Linux filesystem bin path like /usr/local/bin)
3. Copy your binary into the binary folder of the internal structure
4. Create the DEBIAN directory, containing a file called control.
5. Use chmod 755 (or 775) on both the DEBIAN directory and the control file.
6. Fill in the control file with the following template:
Package: hello
Version: 1.0
Architecture: arm64
Maintainer: Internal Pointers <info@internalpointers.com>
Description: A program that greets you.
 You can add a longer description here.
(THE SPACE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT)
7. Build the package
    Command: dpkg-deb --build --root-owner-group helloworld_1.0-1_arm64
    This creates a .deb package in the current wd.
